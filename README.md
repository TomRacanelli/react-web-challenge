# React Coding Challenge
## Requirements 
This is React web application challenge. In attached Picture, you can see several functions but we don’t need all of them. We only see some main functions. Explain more in details section. 
## What we expect from your code
* Clean code
* Readability
* Extensibility
* Maintainability
* Testability
* Documentation & Comment
## Extra details
* You don’t have to use Create [React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html). We will provide sample project. 
* Don't use any extra libraries or external components
    This Screen should display: 
* You have to make button in header bar but don’t need click event
* You can see 2 sections in Content but we don’t need “Croptomize Free” section.
*) In the "Croptomize Pro" section, the price per month has to change according to the size of "Number of Seats". In a nutshell, do not use this part as a picture.
